							Molecular dynamics simulations of neat polymers and polymer - carbon nanotube composites are used to better understand and inform the film and fiber spinning developments. As it is material agnostic, the approach is validated on both PAN-CNT and PVA-CNT systems and can be extended to any semi-crystalline polymer. By maintaining crystallinity when converting to Abaqus, we are able to develop improved representative volumes to describe the semi-crystalline polymer multiscale behavior both in neat and composite functions. Experimental validation is done through the fabrication of polymer films and fibers via dry-wet (gel) spinning. <br>

							Working as part of an international multi-disciplinary group between <b>Northeastern University's Mechanical and Industrial Engineering</b> and <b>Marine and Environmental Sciences</b> departments and the <b>Israeli National Institute of Oceanography, Oceanographic and Limnological Research</b>, I performed research into the impact of surface roughness of rocky coastal surfaces on surface availability to solar radiation using COMSOL Multiphysics. 3D GIS scans of coastal surfaces with 1 cm<sup>2</sup> resolution were converted to ~1 m<sup>3</sup> meshes, and subjected to diurnal solar paths to determine the relationship between surface roughness and area of thermal refugia for sessile organisms.

									<h4>Northeastern College of Engineering PhD Council</h4>
									<p> As one of the first members of the COE PhD Council, I primarily managed and organized events. Beginning in the Fall of 2021, we began offering a weekly coffee hour for College of Engineering PhD students, as well as a monthly TED talk style social event, Science on Tap. Science on Tap is our larger event, for which I organize and arrange speakers, catering, facilities, and most everything else that goes into an event for 60-80 people. Additionally, as members of the COE PhD Council, we help facilitate surveys for the college and meet with faculty and college leadership in an effort to improve the quality of the PhD experience at Northeastern University.   
									</p> 
									
									<h4>Mechanical and Industrial Engineering Graduate Student Council </h4>
									<p>
										Stemming from my role in the COE Ph.D. Council, I am working to help newer Ph.D. students develop a Graduate Council within the Mechanical and Industrial Engineering department. This group will oversee department level events and act similarly to the COE Ph.D. council. I, along with another member of the council, will help with developing department level events and the student group applications necessary to become a standalone organization within the university.
